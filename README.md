# Robbin' Hoodz

Robbin' Hoodz is an "infinite runner" game made with PhaserJS.

In it, you play as old-school outlaw **Robin Hood** as he flees from the scene of his latest act of vigilante wealth re-distribution.

The aim of the game is to continue running along the platforms for the longest distance possible.
